AIM: To create an efficient and flexible digital tool that generates true random dice rolls for gaming, probability experiments, and educational purposes, replicating and expanding upon the functionality of physical dice in a virtual environment. This function returns a list of integers representing the outcome of rolling num_dice dice, each with sides sides. Let me know if you want to extend this for batch rolls, weighted probabilities, or graphical output.
Algorithm:
1.Start the application and prompt the user for the number of dice, sides per die, and trials.
2.Validate user inputs to ensure they are positive integers.
3.Use NumPy to generate random integers for each dice roll over the specified number of trials.
4.Store all roll results in an array for further analysis.
5.Display individual roll results for a selected trial.
6.Optionally, represent results using ASCII art per die roll.
7.Analyze roll data to calculate frequency and distributions.
8.Visualize distributions using a histogram for user interpretation.
